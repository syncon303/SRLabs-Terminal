Scripting commands:

%file=<path_to_file> - executes a script file as a series of commands

%tail=<string> - specify the expected tail of the message 
		which terminal can detect to determine the end of reply.
		String can contain escape sequences for common control characters
		(\n,\r,...)
		

%tailon/%tailoff - enables / disables the tail detection

Note: Using tail is simple way to execute script files fast since it allows the terminal to
determine exact moment when the reply to a previous command is received. Without it the
scripts have to contain manual delays between commands, which renders the scripts slow and
less readable.

Escape character inclusion:
If any of the escape characters are required to be sent in the string, put additional escape
character in the string (string '##' will therefore send '#')

Quotes:
if a string or part of the string is given in quotes, the part in quotes will not be parsed.
if quotes are required in the string, surround the desired quote characters inside different
quote characters(double quotes vs. single quotes).
